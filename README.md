## Previous versions

### 2021-04-19 - 2022-06-09

From the [start with Ingenuity on 2021-04-19](https://github.blog/2021-04-19-open-source-goes-to-mars/) until the [additions on 2022-06-09](https://github.blog/2022-06-09-introducing-achievements-recognizing-the-many-stages-of-a-developers-coding-journey/), the first three Achievements had slightly different designs and names. In other words, they were overhauled on 2022-06-09.

```diff
- GitHub Sponsor
+ Public Sponsor
- Mars 2020 Helicopter Contributor
+ Mars 2020 Contributor
```

Here are the old designs and names:

| Title | Badge |
